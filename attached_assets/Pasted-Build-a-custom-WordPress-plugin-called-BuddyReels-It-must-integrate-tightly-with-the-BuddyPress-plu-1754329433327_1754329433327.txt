Build a custom WordPress plugin called BuddyReels.
It must integrate tightly with the BuddyPress plugin.
The plugin should follow all WordPress.org plugin development standards (no hardcoded paths, proper sanitization, nonce handling, proper enqueuing, etc.).
This is the full MVP scope:

üì¶ Plugin Name: BuddyReels
üîë Functional Requirements:
Reel Upload via BuddyPress Activity Form

Users can upload MP4 videos via the "What's new" activity post form.

Caption input field.

Uploads should be saved securely via wp_handle_upload().

Automatic Thumbnail Generation

Extract the first frame of the video as a thumbnail image.

Use FFmpeg on the server (via exec()).

Save thumbnail as media and associate with video.

Profile Tab: Reels

Add a new "Reels" tab to each BuddyPress profile.

Display user‚Äôs uploaded reels in a responsive grid layout.

Include captions and thumbnails.

Reel Feed (TikTok-style)

Shortcode: [buddyreels_feed]

Displays all published reels in a vertical-scrolling feed (mobile-first).

Videos autoplay and loop, muted by default.

Include optional like + comment count.

BuddyPress Activity Integration

When a reel is uploaded, post it to the user‚Äôs activity stream.

Include thumbnail, caption, and link to the reel‚Äôs page.

Likes & Comments on Reels

Users can like reels (store likes as post meta or activity meta).

Use BuddyPress comments or standard WordPress comments for commenting.

Drafts & Privacy

Allow users to upload reels as drafts (private).

Users can later publish reels from their profile tab.

Drafts are not visible in feed or activity.

Mobile Upload Support

Touch-friendly upload UI on mobile devices.

Show upload progress and preview before submit.

Single Reel Page (Shareable)

Each reel gets a unique permalink: /reels/{slug}/

Displays full video, author, caption, likes, and comments.

Include OpenGraph + Twitter Card meta tags for social sharing.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Constraints
BuddyPress is required for plugin to function.

Use WordPress custom post types or custom tables for reels (up to you).

All uploads must be validated and sanitized.

All front-end JS/CSS should be properly enqueued.

üîÅ Optional Enhancements (not required immediately)
Reel view counts

Hashtags or tagging

Reel reporting/moderation
